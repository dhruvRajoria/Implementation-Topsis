TOPSIS_Implementation
A comprehensive repository demonstrating the implementation of TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) for analyzing an evaluation matrix of text summarization models. This project applies multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) to rank and compare different summarization models based on multiple performance metrics.

üîπ Key Features:
‚úî Implementation of TOPSIS for decision-making in text summarization evaluation
‚úî Preprocessing of evaluation metrics for consistency in ranking
‚úî Calculation of ideal and anti-ideal solutions for optimal ranking
‚úî Visualization of results using plots and graphs for better interpretation

üìå Project Overview:
In text summarization, different models are evaluated based on multiple performance metrics such as ROUGE scores (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L), BLEU, METEOR, etc. The challenge is to rank these models objectively while considering multiple criteria simultaneously. TOPSIS provides a systematic way to achieve this by:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Normalizing the evaluation matrix
2Ô∏è‚É£ Weighting criteria based on importance
3Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying ideal and anti-ideal solutions
4Ô∏è‚É£ Calculating similarity scores and ranking models accordingly

üìä Visualization:
The results are presented using bar charts, radar plots, and comparative tables to highlight the best-performing summarization model.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for researchers and developers working on text summarization evaluation, model comparison, and decision-making in NLP. üöÄ
